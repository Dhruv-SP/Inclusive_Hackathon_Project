All rights of reproduction in any form reserved. 64Financial literacy education has moved from being a \\nlargely private concern to a national public policy issue as \\nit has become increasingly clear that individual financial \\ndecisions collectively affect the national economy. Uncer -\\ntainty about the adequacy of retirement savings, rising debt \\nlevels, and personal bankruptcy are no longer financial \\nissues to be addressed solely by individuals (Braunstein \\n& Welch, 2002; Draut & Silva, 2004; O’Neill, 2006). The \\nassumption that greater knowledge improves financial \\nbehavior has led to efforts, including state mandates, to ex -\\npand financial education at the elementary, secondary, and \\npostsecondary levels.1 Today, 80% of states have adopted \\npersonal finance education standards or guidelines of some \\nkind; this is almost double the number of states (42%) that \\nhad such policies in 1998 (NCEE, 2007). An increasing \\narray of educational program models, materials, and other \\nresources are also now available for use in implementing \\nfinancial education recommendations and mandates (Vitt, \\nReichbach, Kent, & Siegenthaler, 2005). \\nDespite this growing emphasis on financial education, little \\nattention has been paid to understanding the characteristics \\nand needs of the population that is pivotal to the imple -\\nmentation and success of personal finance education – the \\nteachers.

This is important because having had \\nformal education related to personal finance, especially \\ncollege coursework, is a significant predictor of teachers’ \\nperceived competence to teach personal finance topics. \\nA noteworthy finding is that teachers in some subject \\nmatter disciplines continue to receive more preparation in \\npersonal finance than others. Teachers with backgrounds \\nin vocational education and social studies are more likely \\nthan those in other disciplines to have taken personal-fi -\\nnance related coursework for credit, and these teachers (as \\nwell as those in math) are the ones most likely to feel com -\\npetent to teach and to actually be teaching financial topics.\\nAnother conclusion based on findings from this study \\nis that teachers’ ‘capacity to teach’ personal finance is \\nlimited in terms of teachers’ perceived preparedness in \\nboth subject matter and pedagogy. Teachers expressed the \\ngreatest hesitancy about the more technical topic areas of \\nrisk management and insurance and saving and invest -\\ning, but having taken a personal finance-related course in \\ncollege was a significant predictor of likelihood of feeling \\ncompetent to teach five of the six subject areas exam -\\nined. These findings are consistent with what the scant prior research has revealed about teachers’ readiness for \\ndemands of teaching personal finance. They also suggest \\nthat not much has changed over the past 30 years. In one \\nof only two prior studies that examined teachers’ personal \\nfinance-related subject matter knowledge, Garman (1979) \\nfound that teachers answered only about 60% of the ques -\\ntions correctly and that graduates were least knowledge -\\nable about saving and investment (50% of items correct) \\nand taxes (45% correct). Those who had taken a consumer \\neducation course in college had higher scores than those \\nwho had not.

Garman’s objective assessment of teach -\\ners’ subject-matter knowledge is, of course, not directly \\ncomparable with the self-assessment methodology used \\nin the present study, but the similarities in the findings are \\nnotable nonetheless. \\nThe teachers surveyed in this study were also more likely \\nto feel unqualified than qualified in financial education \\npedagogy including ability to use financial education \\nstandards, design curriculum and resources, employ in -\\nstructional strategies, and address learner needs related to \\npersonal finance. All but a very few teachers (12%) said \\nthey were either not well qualified to use or not familiar \\nwith the Jump$tart Coaltion standards for personal finan -\\ncial literacy. An important note is that there appears to be \\na great deal of variation in level of preparedness overall \\namong teachers in various disciplines, with those in voca -\\ntional education areas feeling the best prepared.\\nAgain, these findings are consistent with previous research \\nabout teacher readiness. Parsad, Lewis, & Farris (2000) \\nfound, for example, in a national survey of teacher prepara -\\ntion that while most (96%) teachers felt very well or mod -\\nerately well prepared for teaching overall, they felt much \\nless prepared in specific aspects of pedagogy such as im -\\nplementing state or district curricula (44%), implementing \\nnew methods of teaching (45%), or addressing the needs of \\nstudents from diverse cultural backgrounds (32%). \\nOne of the main implications of this study is that there is a \\ngreat need to expand personal finance educational oppor -\\ntunities for pre-service and in-service teachers in order to \\nmeet both their personal and professional needs. A chief \\nconcern among practicing teachers is whether or not they \\nwill have sufficient money for retirement. They are also \\nconcerned with the related issues of whether they are using \\nthe best strategies for investing their money, how they can Journal of Financial Counseling and Planning  Volume 20, Issue 2 2009 77supplement their income as a teacher, and how they can \\npay for their children’s college education. Taken together, \\nthese concerns suggest that teachers would benefit from \\nfocused personal financial programs related to investment', metadata={}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='these concerns suggest that teachers would benefit from \\nfocused personal financial programs related to investment \\neducation. Based on the literature, teachers are justified \\nin being concerned about short and long-term income \\nadequacy. As a whole, teachers are disadvantaged in pay \\ncompared to those employed in other occupations requir -\\ning similar levels of education (Weaver, 2005). Also, there \\ncontinues to be concern that few teachers are taking advan -\\ntage of tax-deferred retirement contribution options and \\nthat, despite new regulations governing 403b investment \\nplans available to teachers and other nonprofit organization \\nemployees, teachers are still given too little guidance in \\nselecting from among the options available.\\nThe findings of this study also indicate that teachers need \\nassistance in learning more about both financial education \\nsubject matter and pedagogy. Based on teachers’ own per -\\nceptions of their competency, priority should given to the \\ntopic areas of risk management and insurance, saving and \\ninvestment, credit and debt, and financial responsibility \\nand decision making. Since most of the financial educa -\\ntion currently being taught is through integrated rather \\nthan stand-alone curriculum and because there is so much \\napparent variation in teachers’ perceived expertise based \\nupon disciplinary background, financial in-service educa -\\ntion would be most effective if either organized around \\nhomogeneous teaching specialty groups or tailored to \\ninclude disciplinary-specific curriculum and instruction ex -\\namples within heterogeneous in-service groupings. Finally, \\nbecause a majority of teachers see financial education as a \\nsubject that is appropriate primarily for higher grades we \\nalso believe teachers need assistance in understanding the \\ndevelopmental nature of financial reasoning and in learn -\\ning how to make financial concepts accessible at different \\ngrade levels. There are a few good examples of financial \\neducation materials for elementary school age children \\n(e.g., Bailey & Law, 2006); however, most of those cur -\\nrently available are more appropriate for older audiences. \\nThis is an additional area of need – development of finan -\\ncial education curriculum resources that can be used to \\nfacilitate integration across the lower grade levels. \\nReferences\\nAtherton, J.
